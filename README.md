# A modeling of the entropy between the decryption time and the number of encrypted bits.
Polynomial Emulator

This program allowed us to model the relationship between the number of bits encrypted in a message and its decryption time. Our motivation is to research the temporal behavior of messages received and decrypt because decryption is not a constant time algorithm and therefore side channel attacks of the temporal type may well be brought into play.
