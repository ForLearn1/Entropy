# A modeling of the entropy between the decryption time and the number of encrypted bits.
Polynomial Emulator

For non-constant-time algorithms, physical temporal attacks are feasible via the time observed at each execution of the algorithm. Our motivation for measuring the entropy “Decryption time- Bits encrypted” is based on this problem. In this Python program we have constructed a polynomial that allows us to model the entropy between decryption time and the number of encrypted bits
